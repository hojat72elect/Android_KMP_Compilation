********************************************************************************************

<p><b>SimpleLogin</b> is an open source solution to protect your email inbox. It allows you to create quickly a random email address (aka alias). All emails sent to an alias are forwarded to your personal email address. You can use the alias when subscribing to a newsletter, signing up for a new account, giving your email to someone you don't trust. Not only an alias can receive emails, it can also send emails. An alias is a full-fledged email address. Later you can simply block or delete an alias if it's too spammy.</p>

<b>Why SimpleLogin?</b>
When you give away your personal email online, there is a good chance that your email address would end up with a spammer or a hacker. SimpleLogin acts as a firewall to protect your personal email inbox.

<b>What distinguishes SimpleLogin:</b>

<ul>
<li>Open-source and easy to self-host. The self-hosting is based on Docker and could be run on almost any Linux server. The hosting instruction is on our repository at <a href="https://github.com/simple-login/app">https://github.com/simple-login/app</a></li>
<li>Powerful features if you have a domain (only available at premium plan).</li>
<li>Generous free plan: there's no cap on bandwidth or number of replies/sends. The Free Plan is enough for protecting your personal email. Premium Plan targets at more "advanced" users with features like custom domain, unlimited alias or catch-all alias.</li>
