## Vendors/Developers

The device vendors/ROM developers are free to include Amaze apk pre-installed in system. There is no
fee required; *but you must comply with the license* (for more information read
the [GNU GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) or newer).

that users would be able to update directly from Play Store after distribution. Furthermore, a
change in digital signature will break plug-ins.
